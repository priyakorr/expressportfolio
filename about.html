                <p>
                    The Grace new covenant Pentecostal church is affiliated with the Pentecostal mission,
                    which was founded in Srilanka by Pastor. Paul Kutty in 1923. It now has churches in over 
                    65 countries operating under various names. The church exists to bring all people everywhere
                    to the saving knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ through the proclamation of the gospel
                    and equipping believers for every God-glorifying service.  
                </p>

                    Jesus in order to pursue righteousness, their Faith in God and relentless prayer were the 
                    two most important factors in building the Church. They minister along with the other two
